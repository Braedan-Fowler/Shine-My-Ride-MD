                        <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
                        <p class="lead">"I started detailing my own cars years ago because I couldn't find someone who would clean and take care of my vehicle the way I would. We know how special your car is and we clean it like it's our own," Braedan Fowler (Owner).</p>
                        <p class="mb-0"><b>Convenience:</b> One of the main reasons people use a mobile car detailing service is because it's convenient. Our customers don't have to take time out of their busy schedules to drop their car off and pick it up at a detailing shop. Instead, we come to them, whether they're at home, work, or somewhere else. <br>
                            <b>Time-saving:</b> Detailing a car can be a time-consuming process, especially if you're doing it yourself. By hiring a professional mobile detailing company, our customers can save time and focus on other important tasks in their day. <br>
                            <b>Quality of service:</b> We use professional-grade equipment and cleaning products to provide a thorough and high-quality detailing service. Our customers can trust that their car will be cleaned and polished to a high standard. <br>
                            <b>Improved resale value:</b> A well-maintained and clean car is more attractive to potential buyers, which can help increase its resale value. Regular detailing can help preserve the exterior and interior of the car, making it look and feel like new. <br>
                            <b>Protection:</b> Detailing helps protect a car's exterior from environmental factors such as UV rays, dirt, and debris. Regular waxing and polishing can also help prevent scratches and chips in the paint.
